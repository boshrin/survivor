 <P>

 The Survivor Mail Gateway allows email based reply messages to affect
 the system state.  It reads the messages on stdin, executes any valid
 commands found, and records its actions via syslog.  The gateway can
 also relay messages to Persons and Call Lists.

 <P>

 The gateway is used to accept replies in response to previously
 generated alert notifications.  It is not intended to be a general
 purpose interface.  Tokens are required in replies to prevent delayed
 replies from inadvertantly changing state when they are no longer
 relevant, and to provide a frustration against nuisance attacks
 against the gateway.  Tokens are not guaranteed to be secure against
 more sophisticated attacks.

 <P>

 The gateway will not accept messages larger than <TT>MAXMESSAGESIZE</TT>
 as defined in <TT>include/gateway.H</TT>.  This value defaults to
 50,000 bytes.

 <UL>
 <LI>The gateway must run on the same host as the scheduler.
 <LI><TT>sg</TT> uses the standard instance configuration file
     <TT>/etc/survivor/instance.cf</TT> to obtain information
     about the configured Instances.  The location of this file
     cannot be overridden.

 <TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH=100%>

 Installation
 </TD>
 </TR>
 </TABLE>

 <P>

 The gateway is installed in <TT>$INSTDIR/sbin/sg</TT>.  Two-way
 reply messages must be piped into <TT>sg</TT>, the specific
 method for doing so is dependent on the mail system in use.

 <P>
 
 <A ID="mail"></A>
 <H3>Configuring the Mail System</H3>
 
 By default, alert notifications sent by the scheduler should have a
 return address of <TT>$INSTUSER@<I>schedulerhost</I></TT>, although
 this is dependent on the local mail configuration.  The key
 installation step is to intercept reply messages sent to this address
 and direct them to <TT>sg</TT>.  An easy way to do this is by creating
 <TT>$INSTUSER/.forward</TT> with contents like

 <PRE>
 |$INSTDIR/sbin/sg
 </PRE>

 or, to keep a copy of each messages received

 <PRE>
 |$INSTDIR/sbin/sg,\$INSTUSER
 </PRE>

 <TT>$INSTDIR</TT> and <TT>$INSTUSER</TT> must be replaced with their
 actual values.  Additionally, some mail handlers may require the
 entire line to be surrounded by quotes (<TT>"</TT>).  Note that for
 Sendmail, <TT>sg</TT> may need to be run via <TT>smrsh</TT>.

 <P>

 Using procmail, <TT>$INSTUSER/.procmailrc</TT> could contain an entry
 like

 <PRE>
 # Pipe all mail to sg for processing two-way replies
 :0 H
 * ^To:.*$INSTUSER@schedulerhost
 | $INSTDIR/sbin/sg
 </PRE>

 Again, <TT>$INSTDIR</TT> and <TT>$INSTUSER</TT> must be replaced with their
 actual values.

 <P>

 It may also make sense to intercept the messages at a system-wide
 level, rather than wait until delivery to the local user.  This would
 require changes to <TT>/etc/aliases</TT>, <TT>/etc/mail/aliases</TT>,
 the global <TT>procmailrc</TT>, <TT>sendmail.cf</TT>, or any other
 relevant file.

 <P>
 
 <A ID="syslog"></A>
 <H3>Syslogging</H3>

 The gateway syslogs as follows:

  <UL>
  <LI><TT>mail.debug</TT>: Debugging information, including configuration
      file parse errors.  It is possible to enable additional debugging
      to this facility with the <A HREF="cf-gateway.html#debuglevel"><TT>debug
      level</TT></A> keyword in <A
      HREF="cf-gateway.html"><TT>gateway.cf</TT></A>.
  <LI><TT>mail.warning</TT>: Warnings and errors other than configuration.
  <LI><TT>mail.info</TT>: Non-critical message processing information.
  </UL>
 
 In order to generate appropriate processing logs, configure these service in
 <TT>/etc/syslog.conf</TT>.

 <A ID="sg-nextel"></A>
 <H3>With Nextel Two-Way Messaging</H3>

 Messages formatted with the <A HREF=fmm-nextel.html><TT>nextel</TT>
 format module</A> are capable of being replied to and processed by
 the gateway.  Messages must be transmitted via Nextel's two-way
 messaging infrastructure, which as of this writing is not available
 via TAP (modem transmission of pages).  Simply select the appropriate
 command when replying to the alert notification.

 <H3>With SMS Text Messages</H3>

 Messages formatted with the <A HREF=fmm-sms.html><TT>sms</TT> format
 module</A> are capable of being replied to and processed by the
 gateway, however the mechanism is more complicated due to the
 limitations of SMS text messaging.

 <P>

 First, the mail system must be capable of delivering messages
 addressed to <TT>$INSTUSER+x@scheduler</TT>, where <I>x</I> is the
 one letter command described below.  For example,
 <TT>survivor+e@monitor.foo.edu</TT> must be delivered to
 <TT>survivor@monitor.foo.edu</TT>.  Sendmail sites may already have
 this functionality enabled.  Other sites may need to make
 adjustments.  One approach would be to define aliases in
 <TT>/etc/aliases</TT> (if appropriate for the local mail system):

 <PRE>
 survivor+a: survivor
 survivor+e: survivor
 survivor+i: survivor
 </PRE>

 <P>

 In order to reply to an alert notification, <I>forward</I> the
 message (do not reply to it) to the address for the appropriate
 command:

 <UL>
 <LI><B><TT>+a</TT></B>: Acknowledge
 <LI><B><TT>+e</TT></B>: Escalate
 <LI><B><TT>+i</TT></B>: Inhibit
