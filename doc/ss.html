 <P>

 The Survivor Scheduler is a multi-threaded process that schedules and
 executes Checks and Alerts.  All state is maintained on the file
 system, not in memory, to permit other processes to easily access it
 and to prevent data loss if the scheduler unexpectedly exits.  The
 scheduler is designed to be started at system boot time.

 <P>

 The scheduler runs one <A HREF=cf-instance.html>Instance</A>.  Under
 ordinary circumstances, this should be all that is required.
 However, if multiple Instances are required, multiple schedulers can
 be run on the same host, provided they are configured correctly.

 <P>

 The Check scheduler runs once per minute and determines which Checks
 on which hosts have not been run in accordance with the configuration
 files.  Any Check to be run is queued until it can be processed by
 one of the Check worker threads.  The Check worker threads execute
 the Checks and record the results in the state directory.

 <P>

 The Alert scheduler runs once per minute and determines which Checks
 have generated errors that have not been transmitted in accordance
 with the configuration files.  Any Alert to be transmitted is queued
 until it can be processed by one of the Alert worker threads.  The
 Alert worker threads execute the Alerts and record the results in the
 state directory.  The Alert scheduler waits for a period of time
 before commencing operation in order to give the Check scheduler a
 chance to update the state.

 <P>

 State information is maintained for current hosts and services only,
 and is automatically pruned by the scheduler.  History information is
 maintained for all hosts and services, even those removed from the
 configuration, and is never pruned by the scheduler.  (History
 can be pruned by the <A HREF="sc.html">Command Interface</A>).

 <P>

 Sending the scheduler a <TT>SIGHUP</TT> will tell it to reread its
 configuration files at the next appropriate moment.  Note that this
 appropriate moment requires the completion of all outstanding Checks
 (among other things).

 <P>

 <TT>SIGINT</TT>, <TT>SIGQUIT</TT>, or <TT>SIGTERM</TT> will tell the
 scheduler to exit.

 Installation
 </TD>
 </TR>
 </TABLE>

 <P>

 The scheduler is installed in <TT>$INSTDIR/sbin/ss</TT>.  The modules
 it expects to run are installed under <TT>$INSTDIR/mod</TT>.

 <P>

 An <A HREF=cf-instance.html>Instance configuration</A> must be
 created.  It is recommended that the default location of
 <TT>/etc/survivor/instance.cf</TT> be used to prevent complications
 with other utilities, such as the <A HREF=sw.html>Web Interface</A>.

 <P>

 See the instructions for <A HREF=building.html>building and
 installing</A> for details on how to set up the configuration, state,
 and history files required by the scheduler.
