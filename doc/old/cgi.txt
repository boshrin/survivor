				The CGI

About
-----
The cgi is a web gateway for examining check, alert, and configuration
state.  Currently, the cgi is read only.

Usage
-----
The cli accepts the following variables.

	h=host
	i=instance
	s=service
	(all other flags)

- /etc/survivor/cgi.cf (also write a spec for this)

- How to set up logins (always > host > user)

- installed setgid, to avoid this and still have write access the web
  server must run the exectuable as INSTUSER or a user in INSTGROUP

- mkdir statedir w/correct permissions?  (or will verify_directory do this?)
