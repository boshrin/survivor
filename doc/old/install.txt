				Installing Survivor

Prerequisites
-------------
The survivor scheduler requires a platform that implements POSIX
threads.  Currently, the scheduler has only been built under Solaris,
but it should build under other platforms with minimal modifications.

The survivor remote daemon is implemented as a Perl script, and so
should run anywhere Perl can run.

See NOTES for specific patches required for specific operating systems
(especially Solaris 8).

Building
--------
(1) Edit INSTDIR in Makefile.inc in the top level directory to contain
    the location where you would like the package installed.  By
    default, this is /opt/survivor-{version}.  Under this directory,
    various subdirectories (bin, sbin, etc...) will be created.

(2) Edit INSTUSER in Makefile.inc in the top level directory to
    contain the username that will own the package and that the
    scheduler and other programs will run as.  This defaults to
    nobody, as the scheduler requires no special privileges.

(3) Edit INSTGROUP in Makefile.inc in the top level directory to
    contain the group that will own the package.  Only users in this
    group will be able to run the command line interface.  This
    defaults to staff.

(4) In the top level directory, type 'make'.

Installing
----------
(5) In the top level directory, as root, type 'make install'.  The
    following will be installed:

    INSTDIR/sbin/ss
	The survivor scheduler.

    INSTDIR/sbin/sg
        The survivor mail gateway.

    INSTDIR/sbin/sr
	The survivor remote daemon, used by the remote module.

    INSTDIR/sbin/sw
	The survivor CGI (web) interface.

    INSTDIR/bin/sc
	The survivor command line interface.

    INSTDIR/mod/
	Various modules distributed with the package.

Configuring
-----------
(6) Each survivor instance requires a configuration directory, a state
    directory, and a history directory.  Ordinarily, only one survivor
    instance is required.

    The default location for the configuration files is /etc/survivor.
    See config-spec.txt for more information on configuration files.

    The default location for the state directory is
    /var/survivor/state.  This directory MUST exist before the
    scheduler starts.  It must be writeable by the install user
    and by the install group.

     # mkdir -m 770 /var/survivor/state
     # chown $INSTUSER /var/survivor/state
     # chgrp $INSTGROUP /var/survivor/state

    The default location for the history directory is
    /var/survivor/history.  This directory MUST exist before the
    scheduler starts.  It must be writeable by the install user.

     # mkdir -m 750 /var/survivor/history
     # chown $INSTUSER /var/survivor/history
     # chgrp $INSTGROUP /var/survivor/history

Starting
--------
(7) Start the daemon.  A sample script suitable for installing
    in /etc/init.d can be found in init.d/survivor.

Re-configuring
--------------
(8) Change config files, kill -HUP, watch for reparsing errors.
