 <UL>
 <LI><B>flags</B>: Described <A HREF=spec-sw.html>here</A>.  In
     general, <TT>sw</TT> may be accessed with no flags, and the links
     presented may be followed to generate desired views.  Once a view has
     been established, the URI may be bookmarked for future direct access.
 </UL>

 <P>

 The Survivor Web Interface allows the examination of, and with appropriate
 access controls in place the manipulation of, check and alert state.
 By default, anybody may view state who otherwise has access to the URI
 used to access <TT>sw</TT>.

 <P>
 
 The user interface is not described in detail here since it
 should be fairly self-explanatory.
 
 <A ID="depend"></A>

 <UL>
 <LI>The web interface must run on the same host as the scheduler.
 <LI><TT>sw</TT> uses the standard Instance configuration file
     <TT>/etc/survivor/instance.cf</TT> to obtain information about the
      configured Instances.  The location of this file cannot be overridden.

 Clipboards
 </TD>
 </TR>
 </TABLE>

 <P>

 In addition to viewing and modifying survivor state, <TT>sw</TT> also
 offers the ability to keep notes in Clipboards.  A Clipboard must be
 configured before it can be used.  Multiple Clipboards may be configured.
 Clipboards are <I>not</I> locked against simultaneous update, and so
 should be restricted by policy to one owner (user or host) each.
 Only users with proper authorization as defined in <A
 HREF=cf-cgi.html><TT>cgi.cf</TT></A> may access Clipboards.

 <P>

 A Clipboard may be edited by viewing it, making changes, and then
 updating the Clipboard.  Additionally, the details of a current
 <TT>service@host</TT> may be appended to a Clipboard by viewing the
 details and selecting an appropriate link.

 <P>

 The contents of a Clipboard may be sent to any Call List or Call List
 member defined in the <TT>calllist.cf</TT> of any configured
 instance.  The sending option is available when viewing the
 Clipboard.

 <P>

 When the contents are sent to a Call List, Call List rotation does
 <I>not</I> occur.  This is because Call List rotation is not atomic:
 a value is read (lock enforced during read), a new value is computed,
 and then the new value is written (lock enforced during write).
 The scheduler maintains the master lock over Call List state updates,
 and <TT>sw</TT> does not have access to this master lock.

 <UL>
 <LI>A Simple Call List will work correctly if it contains only one member.
     If it contains multiple members, whichever address is "next in line"
     will receive the Clipboard, and this address will remain "next in line".
     <P>

 <LI>A Broadcast CallList will work correctly.
     <P>

 <LI>A Rotating CallList will work correctly, provided the scheduler has
     initialized the list.

 The look and content of the web interface is fully customizable,
 as is its authentication infrastructure.

 <P>

 For information on customizing the web interface, see the <A

 Filters.  For information on adding custom authentication modules,
 see the <A HREF=wam-about.html#custom>documentation</A>.

 Installation
 </TD>
 </TR>
 </TABLE>

 <P>

 The web interface is installed in <TT>$INSTDIR/sbin/sw</TT>.  It is
 installed setgid <TT>$INSTGROUP</TT> so that it may have write access to the
 survivor state files.  If the web interface will only be used read-only,
 or if the web server can be configured to run <TT>sw</TT> as
 <TT>$INSTUSER</TT> or a user in <TT>$INSTGROUP</TT>, the setgid bit may be
 removed.

 <P>

 The easiest way to make <TT>sw</TT> available is to symlink to it
 from the web server's <TT>cgi-bin</TT> directory.  This would make
 the URI <TT>http://survivorhost/cgi-bin/sw</TT>.  Further information
 regarding the configuration of web servers is beyond the scope of this
 document.

 <P>

 <TT>sw</TT> uses its own configuration file, <A
 HREF=cf-cgi.html><TT>cgi.cf</TT></A>, to determine some of its
 behavior.  Among the configurations specified there, a <A
 HREF=cf-cgi.html#kw-statedir>state directory</A> must be defined and
 created.  This directory must be owned and writeable by the user that
 the web server runs as, or writeable by a group that the web server
 user is in.
