 <H3>Scheduler Platforms</H3>

 The <A HREF="ss.html">survivor scheduler</A> requires a platform that
 implements POSIX threads.  (However, any type of platform can be monitored by
 the scheduler.)  The scheduler is known to build on the following
 platforms:

 <UL>
 <LI>AIX 5.3 (powerpc)
 <LI>GNU/Linux 2.4.9 (RedHat 7.2, i686)
 <LI>GNU/Linux 2.4.18 (Debian 3.0/woody, powerpc)
 <LI>GNU/Linux 2.6.9 (RedHat ES4, i686)
 <LI>Solaris 7 (sparc)<BR>
     (<I>This version of Solaris may encounter problems with debugging
     information.  See <A HREF="problems.html">Known Problems</A> for
     more information.</I>)
 <LI>Solaris 8 (sparc)<BR>
     (<I>In order to run under Solaris 8, one or more patches to the
     operating system are required.  Additionally, this version of
     Solaris may encounter problems with debugging information.
     See <A HREF="problems.html">Known Problems</A> for more information.</I>)
 <LI>Solaris 9 (sparc)<BR>
     (<I>Later versions of Solaris have better threading implementations.
     For this reason, Solaris 9 is the recommended Solaris platform,
     especially for large deployments.</I>)
 </UL>

 It should be easy to <A HREF="porting.html">port</A> the scheduler to other
 modern platforms.  However, the scheduler is known <I>not</I> to build
 on these platforms:

 <UL>
 <LI>Darwin 6.x,7.x,8.x/MacOS 10.2.x,10.3.x,10.4.x<BR>
     (<I><TT>sem_init</TT> is not implemented.</I>)
 <LI>Darwin 5.x/MacOS X 10.1.5 and earlier<BR>
     (<I>POSIX thread function <TT>pthread_kill</TT> is missing.</I>)
 <LI>NetBSD<BR>
     (<I>Pth does not support semaphores.</I>)
 <LI>Solaris 2.5.1 and earlier<BR>
     (<I>POSIX thread reader/writer locks are missing.</I>)
 </UL>

 <P>

 <A ID="gcc"></A>
 <H3>GCC</H3>

 If compiling with GCC, versions prior to 2.95, including 2.7.2, are
 known not to work.  An indicative error is reported while building
 <TT>libcm/cmutils.C</TT>, regarding lvalue assignment.  Versions
 2.95.2 and later versions of 2.x are known to work.  Version 3.x and
 later should work (versions 3.3 and 4.1.1 have been successfully
 tested).

 <P>

 Additionally, GCC (confirmed in v2.95.2) should not be used to build
 <TT>-g -O2</TT>.  This will not happen by default.

 <P>

 <A ID="perl"></A>
 <H3>Perl</H3>

 Perl version 5.005 or greater is required for the scheduler host, and
 5.004 or greater is recommended on any <A HREF="sr.html">remote</A> host.

 <P>

 For sites with large numbers of hosts and services, it is recommended
 to build a multi-threaded version of Perl (using ithreads, not
 5005threads) in order for the Perl based checks to run more
 efficiently.  The multi-threaded Perl is only required on the
 scheduler host, and must be version 5.8.0 or greater.

 <P>

 <A ID="dns"></A>
 <H3>DNS</H3>

 Sites with large numbers of hosts and services should pay careful
 attention to the efficiency of their name resolution setup.  It may
 be desirable to place a name server process on the same host as the
 scheduler, or to enable hostname caching in <TT>nscd</TT> (on Solaris
 and Linux), or to otherwise ensure the fast resolution of names.

 <P>

 <A ID="diskio"></A>
 <H3>Disk I/O</H3>

 Sites with large numbers of hosts and services should consider disk
 I/O issues.  The scheduler performs significant amounts of disk
 operations, primarily write operations.  Two approaches can be used
 to increase the concurrency of write operations, both require the
 availability of multiple disks, and both are related to the <A
 HREF="cf-instance.html">instance configuration file</A>.

 <P>

 <OL>
 <LI>Form the multiple disks into a RAID, and configure the state and
     history directories to be located on the RAID.  Depending on the
     hardware and software of the RAID, it will most likely be RAID 0
     (stripe), which increases write concurrency but decreases
     reliability by having additional points of failure.
     <P>
     
 <LI>Establish multiple scheduler instances, and store the data for
     each instance on a different disk.
 </OL>

 <P>

 <A ID="modules"></A>
 <H3>Module Dependencies</H3>

 Some modules require additional pieces to run.  These pieces may or
 may not be installed by default by the host operating system, and may
 already be installed to support the service being checked.

 <P>

 <I>Perl Module Dependencies</I> can generally be downloaded from <A
 HREF="http://www.cpan.org">http://www.cpan.org</A>.  For scheduler
 check modules and transmit modules, the dependency perl module need
 only be installed on the scheduler host.  For remote check modules,
 the dependency perl module must be installed on each host being
 checked.  See <A HREF="cm-about.html">About Check Modules</A> for a
 description of scheduler vs. remote check modules.

 <P>

 To facilitate the installation of the more general perl modules,
 copy the bundle file from <TT>src/modules/Bundle/Survivor.pm</TT>
 to <TT>~/.cpan/Bundle/Survivor.pm</TT>.  Then, start the CPAN shell
 and install the bundle.

 <PRE>
 $ perl -MCPAN -e shell
 cpan> install Bundle::Survivor
 </PRE>

 <I>Executable Module Dependencies</I> must be found in the default
 module <TT>$PATH</TT>, which is defined in
 <TT>INSTDIR/mod/common/Survivor.pm</TT>.  For scheduler check modules
 and transmit modules, the dependency executable need only be installed
 on the scheduler host.  For remote check modules, the dependency
 executable must be installed on each host being checked.  See <A
 HREF="cm-about.html">About Check Modules</A> for a description of
 scheduler vs. remote check modules.

 Modules not listed above should run out of the box.  However, it is still

 <LI>First, determine the user and group that the package will be
     installed as.  The default user is <TT>survivor</TT>.  By default,
     the selected user will own the files that the package generates.
     No special system level services are required, so privileged
     users such as root should not be used.
     <P>

     The default group is <TT>staff</TT>.  Only users in the selected
     group will be able to run the command line interface.  Note that
     any member of the selected group will have permission to edit
     the history files.  If this is not desirable, then access to the
     system should not be provided via that command line interface
     (and those users should not be able to login to the scheduler host).
     This may be corrected in a future release.
     <P>

     <B>Important</B>: The selected user must be a member of the
     selected group in order to properly set group ownership of
     files and directories.
     <P>

 <LI>Select an installation directory.  By default, the package will
     install in <TT>/usr/local</TT>, but for ease of maintenance it
     may be desirable to use a name like <TT>/opt/survivor</TT> or
     <TT>/usr/local/survivor</TT>.  Various subdirectories will be
     created (if they don't already exist) under the selected
     directory.
     <P>

 <LI>Run <TT>configure</TT>.  By default, <TT>configure</TT> will
     attempt to build with OpenSSL.  If OpenSSL is unavailable, or
     not in one of the compiler's default include directory, it may
     be necessary to tell <TT>configure</TT>.  If building with SSL
     results in errors about <TT>openssl/des.h</TT> declarations,
     try adding <TT>-DNO_DES</TT> to <TT>$CXXFLAGS</TT> before
     invoking <TT>configure</TT>.
     <P>

     A working version of <TT>g++</TT> is required, other compilers
     may work.  (Sun Workshop CC v6 did not previously test successfully.)
     A working version of <TT>lex</TT> is also required.  <TT>flex</TT>
     and Solaris <TT>/usr/ccs/bin/lex</TT> are both known to work.
     <P>

     On AIX, it may be necessary to configure <TT>--enable-shared=no</TT>
     in order to avoid errors about <TT>Cannot load program</TT> and
     <TT>Cannot load module libparsexml.a(libexpat.so.0)</TT> when
     starting the scheduler.
     <P>

     On AIX, it is recommended that GNU tools such as <TT>make</TT>,
     <TT>install</TT>, and <TT>flex</TT> be used.
     <P>

     An example using the default user and group but with OpenSSL
     in a non-default location:

     <PRE>
     % ./configure --with-openssl=/opt/openssl
     </PRE>

     Using a separate build directory, a custom installation directory,
     and a different username:

     <PRE>
     % mkdir obj
     % cd obj
     % ../configure --prefix=/opt/survivor --enable-user=monitor
