 This document contains details of the SURVIVOR implementation.  It
 contains no information necessary for the operation of the systems
 monitor that is not available in the general sections of this

 <P>
 
 The SURVIVOR scheduler (<A HREF=ss.html><TT>ss</TT></A>) is
 responsible for scheduling the execution of checks and alerts.
 Ordinarily, the scheduler attempts to track as closely as possible to
 the schedules configured in <A
 HREF="cf-schedule.html"><TT>schedule.cf</TT></A>.  However, under
 certain circumstances, the scheduler (if not told otherwise) will
 adjust these schedules in a collection of methods called <I>smart
 scheduling</I>.

 <A ID="staggered"></A>
 <H3>Staggered Scheduling</H3>

  For large sites, checking all hosts for a service simultaneously
  can result in slowdowns and timeouts.  While the threaded check
  utilities in <TT>libcm</TT> and <TT>Survivor::Check.pm</TT> will
  prevent too many hosts from being checked simultaneously, if the
  number of hosts is large enough, timeouts will be reported because
  the master check process will not be able to complete in time.

  <P>

  If smart scheduling is enabled, staggered scheduling will be used
  to spread the checking of the hosts over the interval defined for
  the schedule in effect.  Staggered scheduling is only used when a
  minimum number of hosts are monitored for the same service on the
  same schedule.

  <P>

  For each service, the scheduler will sort the monitored hosts
  according to the schedules on which they are monitored.  The
  scheduler will then determine the interval for each schedule, divide
  that by the timeout for the check, and spread the hosts across the
  result.  Once the maximum number of hosts have been scheduled, only
  hosts in a failed state (where the return code is not
  <TT>MODEXEC_OK</TT>) will be added to the list of hosts to be
  checked until the next run of the scheduler.

  <P>

  For example, the service <TT>ping</TT> is checked on 100 hosts using
  a schedule defined with the frequency of <TT>every 15 minutes</TT>,
  and another 50 hosts using a schedule defined with the frequency of
  <TT>every 30 minutes</TT>, and the service has a timeout of three
  minutes.  The maximum number of hosts to be scheduled simultaneously
  from the first group will be <TT>100 / (15 / 3) = 20</TT>, while the
  maximum number of hosts from the second group will be <TT>50 / (30
  / 3) = 5</TT>.

  <P>
 
 <A ID="transient"></A>
 <H3>Transient Failure Scheduling</H3>

  If a check module fails to return any results for any hosts, it may
  be due to a transient failure of the module.  (Programmers aren't
  perfect, after all.)  If smart scheduling is enabled, the scheduler
  will wait 30 seconds and then retry if a check module fails to return
  any results and does not time out.  If the module fails a second time,
  it will then be marked as misconfigured.
