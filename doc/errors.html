 Although error messages are generally written to be transparent and
 understandable in context, some, by virtue of the underlying code
 design, may seem a little confusing.

 <H4>Error</H4>

 When parsing the configuration files, 

   <PRE>
   *lex* Unexpected token at line 79 (state 7): "#commented"
   </PRE>

 <H4>Sample</H4>

   <PRE>
   1024 *lex* Unexpected token at line 79 (state 7): "#commented"
   1024 *lex* Unexpected token at line 79 (state 7): "out"
   1024 *lex* Unexpected token at line 79 (state 7): "block"
   1024 || 3 errors encountered while parsing /home/symon/sample/config/check.cf
   sc: WARNING: Configuration parse failed
   </PRE>

 <H4>Explanation</H4>

 The configuration parser, due to the complexities of the underlying
 parsing mechanism, requires all comments to be terminated with a
 newline.  A comment at the end of the file might not have a newline
 after it, causing the parser to fail.

 <P>

 Simply add a newline after the comment to fix this problem.

   State::lock_type_state failed to open .../lock
   </PRE>

 <H4>Sample</H4>

   <PRE>
   % sc -i instance clstate oncall
   [oncall]
   sc: WARNING: State::lock_calllist_state failed to open
   /var/instance/state/calllist/oncall/lock

   sc: WARNING: State::lock_calllist_state failed to open
   /var/instance/state/calllist/oncall/lock
   -> somebody@site.org is now on call
   </PRE>

 <H4>Explanation</H4>
   
 When configuration files are updated, it is the responsibility of the
 scheduler to update the state directories in accordance with the new
 configuration.  If other utilities, such as the command interface,
 are run with the new configuration before the scheduler is told of
 the update, they may try to access state files or directories that do
 not yet exist.

 <P>

 In the case of the sample above, the <I>oncall</I> call list was
 added to <TT>calllist.cf</TT>.  Before the scheduler was told of the
 update, the command interface was run to get the state of the new
 call list.  Since the scheduler has not made the call list state
 directories consistent, the
 directory <TT>/var/instance/state/calllist/oncall</TT> does not yet
 exist, and so its lock file cannot be opened.

 <H4>Error</H4>

   Lots and lots of spewage in <TT>/var/log/survivor-instance.log</TT>.

 <H4>Sample</H4>
   
   <PRE>
   ss: WARNING: state_consistency failed to create service state directory
   ss: WARNING: Unable to create host history directory
   ss: WARNING: CheckState::lastcheck failed to open
   ss: WARNING: CheckState::write_results failed to reset permissions on
   </PRE>

 <H4>Explanation</H4>

 Most likely, the user running the scheduler is not <TT>INSTUSER</TT>
 or is not a member of <TT>INSTGROUP</TT>, and so cannot properly
 access and update the files.  See <A HREF=building.html>the building
 instructions</A> for more details.

 <HR>

 <H4>Error</H4>

   On certain Linux platforms, <TT>SIGHUP</TT> sometimes causes the
   scheduler to exit, complaining the scheduler is restarting too
   frequently.

 <H4>Sample</H4>

   <PRE>   
   ss: WARNING: Keepalive process is restarting the scheduler too frequently.
   ss: WARNING: There may be a configuration file error or some other problem.
   ss: WARNING: Keepalive process is exiting as a precaution.
   </PRE>

 <H4>Explanation</H4>

 This is a bug in the system's implementation of <TT>sigwait(3)</TT>.
 Instead of returning the proper signal sent to the appropriate thread
 (in this case, SIGHUP, or 1), the non-existant signal 0 is sent.
 Since the scheduler cannot tell what signal 0 really means, the
 scheduler exits.  When run under keepalive (<TT>ss -k</TT>), the
 keepalive daemon will restart the scheduler, effectively simulating a
 <TT>SIGHUP</TT>.  However, if this is done too often (more than once
 per minute), the keepalive exits, assuming there is a bigger problem.

 <P>

 <I>Update</I>: This appears to have been fixed.  libc version 2.3.2
 is known to work properly.

 <H4>Error</H4>

   <PRE>
   Failed to queue check 'service' (check may already be scheduled)
   </PRE>

 <H4>Sample</H4>

   <PRE>
   ss: WARNING: Failed to queue check 'syslogd' (check may already be
   scheduled)
   </PRE>

 <H4>Explanation</H4>

 Every minute, the check scheduler attempts to schedule any checks
 that are due to be executed.  If a particular check takes more than a
 minute to execute, the check scheduler will attempt to schedule that
 check again.

 <P>

 To prevent the same process from being queued multiple times (and
 thus causing backlogs or concurrency problems), the scheduler will
 produce the above error message if a previously scheduled check with
 the same name has not yet completed.

 <HR>
 
 <H4>Error</H4>

   <PRE>
   CheckState::lastcheck failed to open .../lastcheck
   </PRE>

 <H4>Sample</H4>

   <PRE>
   ss: WARNING: CheckState::lastcheck failed to open
   /var/instance/state/host/hostname/service/lastcheck (No such file
   or directory)
   </PRE>

 <H4>Explanation</H4>

 When a new check or host is added, there is no way to guarantee that
 the check scheduler will notice before the alert scheduler.  When
 both hostname and service are known to be valid, this warning may
 still be generated.  This is due to the alert scheduler noticing the
 new check or host before the check scheduler, and so there is no
 lastcheck state to be examined.

 <P>

 This warning should not continue after a minute or two, by which time
 the new check or host will have been queued by the check scheduler.
 Note that setting an alert shift time in <TT>schedule.cf</TT> will
 not eliminate this message, as the alert shift time only adjusts the
 period during which alerts are generated, and not the relative times
 compared to the check scheduler within that period.

 <P>

 <I>Update</I>: Due to changes within the scheduler, this error should
 no longer occur.

 <H4>Sample</H4>

   <PRE>
   HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
   </PRE>

 <H4>Explanation</H4>

 Some dynamic libraries, including the OpenSSL libraries such as <TT>libssl</TT>
 or <TT>libcrypto</TT>, are not in the runtime <TT>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</TT> of
 the web interface.

 <P>

 Ordinarily, the paths to these libraries are encoded into the
 executable when the package is built.  If, however, these libraries
 are moved or removed, when the program is executed the runtime linker
 will fail to resolve symbol definitions and the program will not run.

 <P>

 It may be possible to replicate this failure by manually running the
 program:

 <PRE>
 % unsetenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH
 % ./sw
 % ld.so.1: ./sw: fatal: libssl.so.0.9.6: open failed: No such file or directory
 Killed
 </PRE>

 <P>

 To fix this problem, replace the libraries or rebuild the package with
 the new locations included in <TT>Makefile.inc</TT>.
