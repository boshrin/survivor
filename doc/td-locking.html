 <P>

 This document contains details of the SURVIVOR implementation.
 It contains no information necessary for the operation of the
 systems monitor that is not available in the general sections of
 this manual.

 <P>

 The SURVIVOR scheduler (<A HREF=ss.html><TT>ss</TT></A>) is written
 as a multi-threaded application in order to faciliate the concurrent
 execution of the various modules within the system.  In addition,
 other parts of the package, notably the user interfaces, including
 <A HREF=sc.html><TT>sc</TT></A>, <A HREF=sg.html><TT>sg</TT></A>, and
 <A HREF=sw.html><TT>sw</TT></A>, can operate concurrently with the
 scheduler.

 <P>

 Given all these competing entities demanding access to the resources
 of the system, including the state storage, locking must be implemented
 in order to prevent corrupt or inaccurate data.  This document describes
 the locking implemented by SURVIVOR.

 <A ID="state"></A>
 <H3>State Locking</H3>

 The most critical resource is the state hierarchy.  Host state,
 service state, and calllist state are protected by lockfiles
 controlled by <TT>lockf()</TT>.  This ensures different components of
 the system do not read partial or incorrect information or perform
 simultaneous writes to the state files.

 <P>

 When state is updated, the mtime of the lockfile protecting that
 state is also updated.  This is because the scheduler may cache state
 information to reduce disk access, and by checking the modification
 time on the file can determine whether or not it is necessary to
 perform the additional disk operations necessary to read state from
 disk.  Note that in the current implementation only check state is
 cached.  Since the same lockfile protects both check and alert state,
 when alert state is also cached updating either check or alert state
 will invalidate the cache of both for the service@host in question.
 (This could be addressed by using atime vs mtime, or by creating a
 new file to be stat'd.)

 <P>

 See the <A HREF="history">History Locking</A> section immediately
 following for important additional information.

 <A ID="history"></A>
 <H3>History Locking</H3>

 History files are locked since concurrent updates are possible
 (although rare).  The locking mechanism is similar to state locking,
 but using a different filename and without the mtime updates.

 <P>

 If a service needs to lock both state and history simultaneously,
 the correct order for doing so is

 <OL>
 <LI>Lock state
 <LI>Lock history
 <LI>Unlock history
 <LI>Unlock state
 </OL>

 <A ID="scheduler"></A>
 <H3>Scheduler Locking</H3>

 Within the scheduler process, multiple threads of execution may
 require access to scheduler resources.  Of greatest interest from a
 practical standpoint is the read/write lock protecting the global
 Configuration object.  When any thread requires configuration
 information, a read lock is obtained.  If a new configuration becomes
 available (say, via <TT>SIGHUP</TT>), a write lock is requested, and
 will only be granted upon the release of all outstanding read locks.
 Execution of a check currently requires a read lock, and so any
 <TT>SIGHUP</TT> received will be deferred until the check has completed.

 <P>

 Additionally, access to the internal alert and check processing queues
 and timer array are controlled.  Call list state is controlled globally,
 and cached state data is protected on a per-data basis.

 <A ID="fix"></A>
 <H3>Fix Locking</H3>

 Fix locking is required to prevent undesirable concurrent execution
 of fix modules.  When a fix is scheduled for a given service@host, by
 default no other fix may run for the same service@host.  According to
 the configuration, fixes may also lock out an entire service or an
 entire host instead.  Locks are implemented as symbolic links with
 expiration times to prevent a failed fix module from indefinitely
 blocking other fix attempts.
