 <LI>v1.0 removes support for the <I>notwarncount</I> and <I>notprobcount</I>
     arguments to the <A HREF="cm-snmp.html"><TT>snmp</TT></A> check module.
     There is no replacement for this functionality.

     <P>

 <LI>v1.0 adds a <I>snmpversion</I> argument to the <A

     default SNMP version used is '1'.  For installations where these
     modules were previously used with a different SNMP version, add
     the appropriate version as an argument to all relevant checks.

     <P>

 <LI>v1.0 displays the first time a check returned the current result,
     via both the command line and web interfaces.  When upgrading to
     v1.0, the first check time is not available, so the time the
     check runs first after the upgrade is used instead.  This is
     inconsistent with the number of instances reported by the same
     interfaces.

 <LI>v0.9.7 changes some flags to the web interface (<TT>sw</TT>) and

     <LI>The flags <TT>h</TT> and <TT>s</TT> are no longer used to

     </UL>     

     <P>

 <LI>v0.9.7 changes the specification for <TT>callliststatus</TT> files
     in order to allow substitutions to properly end.  Rotating
     call lists may lose their place following the upgrade.  Before
     upgrading, determine who is on call for each rotating call list.

 <LI>v0.9.6 removes the <TT>parallel</TT> check module.  This module
     did not perform any checks, but ran other checks in parallel,
     reducing the time required to run them.

     Modules run under the <TT>parallel</TT> module can simply be
     run serially instead.
     
     <P>

     <A HREF="cm-about.html#custom">Other methods</A> are available for
     module parallelization.  Most modules included with the package
     use these methods by default.

     <P>

 <LI>v0.9.6 converts check, fix, and transport modules to accept
     arguments via XML documents.  Custom <A

 <LI>v0.9.5 converts most state files to an XML based format in order
     to facilitate the addition of new features both in this release
     and in future releases.

     <P>

     In order to convert the existing state files, as root stop the
     v0.9.4 scheduler and then run the <TT>convert-state.pl</TT> script
     in <TT>src/util/upgrading</TT>.  This must be done while the
     scheduler is stopped.  Run the script once for each
     <TT>statedir</TT> directory defined in
     <TT>/etc/survivor/instance.cf</TT>.  Then, start the 0.9.5
     scheduler.

     <P>

     If this conversion is not performed, all existing state (but not
     history) will be lost when the 0.9.5 scheduler is started.
    
     <P>

 <LI>v0.9.5 adds a <TT>tmpdir</TT> keyword to <TT>instance.cf</TT>, used
     for components of the system that require the ability to write
     temporary files.  The default value is <TT>/tmp</TT>, which is not
     suitable if the system is installed on a host accessible by
     non-trusted users.  See <A

 <LI>v0.9.4 overhauls the internal management of history records in
     order to facilitate several changes now and to prepare for
     additional changes later.  While most of these changes are not
     visible, the format of history records has changed.

     <P>

     In order to convert existing history records, as root run the
     <TT>convert-history.pl</TT> script in <TT>src/util/upgrading</TT>.
     This must be done while the scheduler is stopped.  It can be done
     after the 0.9.4 scheduler has been installed as long as it is not
     currently running.  Run the script once for each
     <TT>historydir</TT> directory defined in
     <TT>/etc/survivor/instance.cf</TT>.

      <PRE>
      scheduler# /etc/init.d/survivor stop
      scheduler# cd src/util/upgrading
      scheduler# ./convert-history.pl /survivor/sample/history
      scheduler# /etc/init.d/survivor start
      </PRE>

     <P>

     If necessary, it is safe to rerun <TT>convert-history</TT> twice on
     the same directory, as long as the scheduler is not running.

     <P>

     Strictly speaking, converting existing history records is not
     necessary.  However, having unconverted history records may
     prevent the 0.9.4 utilities (including the history retrieval and
     rotation functions of <TT>sc</TT> and the reporting function of
     <TT>sw</TT>) from completing successfully.

     <P>

 <LI>v0.9.4, by default, disables the command line interface for the
     root user.  This is to increase accountability, as at larger sites
     many administrators may have access to the root account, making it
     difficult to determine who, for example, inhibited alerts for a
     host.  Since it is not necessary to be root to run <TT>sc</TT>, no
     functionality is lost.  However, if it is desired to have the root
     user be able to run the command line interface, simply add the
     following line to each instance defined in <TT>instance.cf</TT>:

      <PRE>
      allow root
      </PRE>

     For more information, see the <A HREF=cf-instance.html>instance
     configuration file documentation</A>.

     <P>

 <LI>The 0.9.4 web interface has been overhauled, with two notable
     changes.  First, cookies are now required for authenticated
     sessions.  Second, the format of several keywords in
     <TT>cgi.cf</TT> has changed:

     <UL>
     <LI>The <TT>authtype</TT> keyword has been deleted, with
         functionality moved into <A
	 HREF="cf-cgi.html#authmods">authentication modules</A>
	 and <A HREF="cf-cgi.html#authz">authorization</A> keywords.
     <LI>The <TT>authloginurl</TT>, <TT>authlogouturl</TT>,
         <TT>authvalidateurl</TT> and <TT>authservice</TT> keywords
	 have been replaced with the <A HREF="wam-wind.html">wind
	 WebAuth module</A>.
     </UL>

     For full details of how authentication and authorization now
     works, see the documentation for <A HREF="cf-cgi.html">cgi.cf</A>
     and the sample configuration file in the source <TT>config</TT>
     directory.

 Upgrading from 0.9.2 to 0.9.3

 <P>

 0.9.3 removes a dependency on <TT>sendmail</TT>.  In order to ensure
 alerts transmitted with the <TT>mail</TT> transmit module are
 successfully sent out, the Perl module <TT>Mail::Mailer</TT> must
 be installed on the scheduler host.

 <P>

 Additionally, 0.9.3 overhauls the configuration of dependencies.
 Type II dependencies were improperly implemented in prior releases.
 For information on Type II dependencies, see the <A
 HREF=cf-dependency.html#dep2>documentation</A>.  Any Type II
 dependencies in <TT>dependency.cf</TT> must be converted.

 <P>

 Type I dependencies have a new syntax, as defined in the <A
 HREF=cf-dependency.html#dep1>documentation</A>.  Any Type I
 dependencies in <TT>dependency.cf</TT> must be converted to the new
 syntax.  For example,

  <PRE>
  depend foo on bar status

 would become

  <PRE>
  depend {
    checks { foo }
    for all hosts
    on bar status

 <OL>
 <LI><A HREF=building.html>Build</A> the new version.

 <LI>In <A HREF=cf-calllist.html><TT>calllist.cf</TT></A>, change any
     rotating call lists to rotate using a schedule instead of an
     explicit time.  For example, a call list originally defined as

     call list foo {
       notifies {
 	 jane@foo
         joe@foo

     <P>
     
 <LI>Also in calllist.cf, switch to Person-based call lists.  Note that
     because the state file format for call lists has changed, conversion
     of call lists can be slightly complicated.  There are three options.
     <P>

     <OL>
     <LI>The easiest procedure is to simply change the definitions.

	     jane
	     joe

	 Note that this procedure will reset simple and rotating call
	 lists, and may confuse any existing substitutions.
	 <P>
	
     <LI>To clear out all previous state, including any existing
         substitutions, first remove all the directories under the
	 directory <TT>calllist</TT> in each instance's state directory.
	 To determine the state directory, see the instance configuration
	 file, which is usually <TT>/etc/survivor/instance.cf</TT>.
	 <P>

	 Then, follow the instructions for #1, above.  This will still
	 reset simple and rotating call lists, but there will be no
	 confused entries for substitutions.
	 <P>

     <LI>If it is necessary to maintain previous state, it is possible

 <LI>The state file formats for check state and alert state have changed
     to support new features introduced in v0.9 and to improve performance.
     In order to preserve 0.8.x state, run the <TT>movestate.sh</TT> script
     found in <TT>src/util/upgrading</TT> once for each <TT>statedir</TT>
     directory defined in <TT>/etc/survivor/instance.cf</TT>.  If the script

 <LI>In <A HREF=cf-schedule.html><TT>schedule.cf</TT></A>, redefine the
     alertplans.  Alertplans are now defined in terms of <I>tries</I>
     rather than the number of check failures.  Whereas in v0.8.x an
     alert action was based on the number of times a check failed (this
     ability is still retained in v0.9 alertplans, but in a less prominent
     way), v0.9 selects alert actions based on the number of times an alert
     is transmitted.  See the <A HREF=cf-schedule.html>documentation</A>
     for full details, but as an example

     <PRE>
     alertplan standard {
       default {

	   alert unix-mailer
	   using standard schedule

	 using standard schedule {
	   try { alert unix-mailer }
	 }
       }
     }
     </PRE>

     while in the following example, where multiple <I>returngroup problem</I>
     stanzas were required to allow 1 failure overnight,

     <PRE>
     alertplan replicated {
       on returngroup problem {
         after 2 warnings {
           alert unix-pager

       on returngroup problem {

       default {
         after 2 warnings {
	   alert unix-mailer
	   using extended schedule
	 }
       }
     }
     </PRE>

     would become the less redundant

     <PRE>
     # Putting this here makes it the default for all alertplans through
     # the end of the file, or until redefined.
     after 2 check failures
    
     alertplan replicated {
       on returngroup problem {
	 using extended schedule {
	   try 2 times {
	     allow 1 failed host during overnight schedule
	     alert unix-pager
	   }
	   try {
	     allow 1 failed host during overnight schedule
	     alert unix-pager
	     flag escalated   # This is actually optional, since the second try

 <LI>Also in <A HREF=cf-schedule.html><TT>schedule.cf</TT></A>, the
     semantics of global notify on clear have changed.  Instead of
     applying to all alertplans, a global notify on clear is now a
     default value, and applies to all alertplans defined after it
     (but not before it), until redefined or until the end of the
     file.  To replicate the v0.8 behavior, make sure the notify on
     clear statement is before the first alertplan definition, and add
     the keyword <TT>default</TT>.  For example:

     <PRE>
     alertplan foo {
       ...
     }

     # enable global notify on clear
     notify using bar schedule on clear
     </PRE>

     becomes

     <PRE>
     # this applies to all subsequently defined alertplans, unless overridden
     # or redefined
     default notify using bar schedule on clear

     alertplan foo {
       ...
     }
     </PRE>
     <P>
     
 <LI>In <A HREF=cf-check.html><TT>check.cf</TT></A>, all check modules
     must now be converted to named argument style.  Unfortunately,
     the only way to do this is to read the documentation for each
     module and convert each entry appropriately.  The reason this is
     so hard is the exact reason named arguments have been introduced:
     the old format was inconsistent, hard to read, and hard to use.
     <P>
    
 <LI>Also in <A HREF=cf-check.html><TT>check.cf</TT></A>, the remote
     module is no longer a special type of check module, but is now
     one of a new class of modules called <A
     HREF=tm-about.html><I>transport modules</I></A>.  In order for a
     module to run remotely, a transport module must be defined for it
     to use.  A simple example to port a typical v0.8 entry (including
     the conversion to named arguments, described above) would change

     <PRE>
     check mailq {
       module remote(mailq,/var/spool/mqueue,0,1000:2000)
     }

     check swap {
       module remote(swap,80,90)
     }
     </PRE>

     to
    
     <PRE>
     transport remote {
       module plaintext {}
     }

     check mailq {
       module mailq {
         queuedir /var/spool/queue   # This could be omitted, it is the default
	 age      0                  # This could also be omitted, same reason
	 warn     1000
	 prob     2000
       }
       via remote
     }

     check swap {
       module swap {
         warn     80
	 prob     90
       }
       via remote
     }
     </PRE>
     <P>
     
 <LI>Also in <A HREF=cf-check.html><TT>check.cf</TT></A>, the
     semantics of the global check timeout have changed.  Instead of
     applying to all checks that do not define their own timeout, the
     global check timeout is now a default value, and applies to all
     checks defined after it (but not before it), until redefined or
     until the end of the file.  Until it is defined, the initial
     default timeout of 45 seconds will apply.  To replicate the v0.8
     behavior, make sure the timeout statement is before the first
     check definition, and add the keyword <TT>default</TT>.  For
     example:

     <PRE>
     check foo {
       ...
     }

     # set global timeout
     timeout 3 minutes
     </PRE>

     becomes

     <PRE>
     # this applies to all subsequently defined checks, unless overridden
     # or redefined
     default timeout 3 minutes

     check foo {
       ...
     }
     </PRE>
     <P>
     
 <LI>In <A HREF=cf-dependency.html><TT>dependency.cf</TT></A>, changes
     are required for both Type I and Type II dependencies.  Type I
     dependencies simply need the keyword <TT>status</TT> appended.
     For example:

     <PRE>
     depend all on ping
     </PRE>

     becomes

     <PRE>
     depend all on ping status
     </PRE>

     Type II dependencies need to be converted to named arguments, the
     same as for check modules, described earlier.  Note that Type II
     dependencies do not currently support transport modules.  This
     will be addressed with a forthcoming revision of the dependency
     mechanisms.
     <P>
     
 <LI>Test the new configuration.  One way to do this is by using the 0.9
     <A HREF=sc.html><TT>sc</TT></A> to manually run some or all checks.
     <P>
     
 <LI>Start the 0.9 scheduler.
