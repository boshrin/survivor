 <P>

 The Unix Systems Group of Columbia University Information Technology
 responsible for around 200 hosts, ranging from desktop workstations to
 file servers for 60,000 users.  The monitoring system used to monitor
 these systems was designed at a time when there were closer to 10
 hosts, and it became clear that a replacement was needed.

 <P>

 A search began for a replacement product, but none met the exact
 requirements, which included the following:

 <UL>
 <LI>Reliable
 <LI>Easy to use
 <LI>Easy to maintain
 <LI>Scalable
 <LI>Modular
 <LI>State that appropriately survives reconfiguration
 <LI>Time aware
 <LI>Check and alert behaviors defined by hosts and/or services
 <LI>Logical groupings of hosts
 <LI>Acknowledgements
 <LI>Escalations
 <LI>History records for long term status monitoring
 <LI>Dependencies
 <LI>Call list maintenance
 <LI>Local vs remote checking
 <LI>Configurable levels of failure
 <LI>Enabling/disabling of services, hosts, or service@host pairs
 <LI>Configuration files that are easy to read and edit
 <LI>Error checking that provides useful information rather than
     bizarre behavior
 </UL>

 And so the survivor project was established.

 <P>

 The central portion of the package is the survivor <A
 HREF="ss.html">scheduler</A> (<TT>ss</TT>).  It is a multi-threaded
 daemon that handles the scheduling and execution of checks and
 alerts.  The scheduler runs an
 <I>instance</I>, which is a set of configuration files, state, and
 history.  Multiple instances can be created for multiple
 configurations, with each instance run via a separate scheduler.

 <P>

 The scheduler executes checks and alerts in accordance with its
 configuration files.  Checks and alerts are implemented by modules
 which may be written in any language so long as they conform with the
 appropriate specifications.  The results from these checks and alerts
 are stored in state and history files.

 <P>

 Checks, by default, execute on the host where the scheduler runs.
 This is sufficient to cover many cases, such as checking services like
 HTTP, SMTP, IMAP, etc.  The survivor <A HREF="sr.html">remote daemon</A>
 (<TT>sr</TT>) is provided to facilitate performing checks that must be
 performed on individual hosts.

 <P>

 The state may be viewed and manipulated by other programs, including
 the <A HREF="sc.html">command line interface</A> (<TT>sc</TT>), the
 <A HREF="sw.html">web interface</A> (<TT>sw</TT>), and the <A
 HREF="sg.html">mail gateway</A> (<TT>sg</TT>).
