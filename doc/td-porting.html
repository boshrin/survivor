 <P>

 This document contains details of the SURVIVOR implementation.  It
 contains no information necessary for the operation of the systems
 monitor that is not available in the general sections of this
 manual.

 Porting
 </TD>

 <P>
 
 Only the scheduler and related core portions of the package should
 need to be ported, as most of the check modules that can run remotely
 are written in perl or another scripting language, and so should run
 without modification on the desired target platforms.

 <P>

 In order to port the scheduler, the target platform must support
 POSIX threading.  The following steps should be followed:

 <OL>
 <LI>Modify the top level <TT>Configure</TT> script to recognize the
     new platform and generate the appropriate top level defines.
 <LI>Add a stanza to <TT>include/os.H.in</TT> for the new platform.
 <LI>If the platform does not define <TT>time_t</TT> as a long, redefine
     it, fix the code, or switch platforms.
 <LI>Try building the package.  Any changes that need to be made should
     be tagged with descriptive labels, eg

     <PRE>
     #if defined(_HAVE_GETHOST_WITH_POINTER)
     </PRE>

     and not

     <PRE>
     #if defined(LINUX)
     </PRE>

     Add the appropriate defines to <TT>include/os.H.in</TT> and then
     rerun <TT>Configure</TT> to generate a new <TT>os.H</TT>.
 </OL>

 <H3>MT-Level</H3>

 (The following note on MT-Level would be more appropriate in a general
 "developer's notes" sort of page, if one existed.)

 <P>

 Regardless of an object's MT-Level, Constructors are always Safe (although
 it may not make sense to call them more than once) and Destructors are
 always Unsafe.

 <P>

 <UL>
 <LI>Safe indicates that all other methods in an object are Safe.
 <LI>Unsafe indicates that the object must be protected in a multithreaded
  environment.
 <LI>Exceptions within an object are noted.
 </UL>

 <A ID="gethostbynamer"></A>
 <H3><TT>gethostbyname_r</TT></H3>

 <TT>gethostbyname_r</TT> is not implemented in a standard fashion.  It
 should be replaced with <TT>getaddrinfo()</TT>.  Until then, note the
 following for AIX:

 <PRE>
 According to an IBM engineer in the Usenet posting below,
 gethostbyname_r() is a wrapper around gethostbyname().

 http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;selm=3B7BCE0B.DF8D5E4E%40us.noibm.com

 It seems that gethostbyname() writes results to a per-thread
 allocated area which makes it thread safe. The gethostbyname_r()
 wrapper is supposed to copy this data into the malloc'ed buffer
 provided by curl. It seems that it performs a shallow copy, rather
 than the deep copy performed by curl's own pack_hostent() function.

 This means that pointers in the returned hostent structure point to
 the shared gethostbyname() buffer, and is therefore overwritten by
 calls to this function.
